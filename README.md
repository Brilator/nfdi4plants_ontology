# dpbo 

With the DataPLANT biology ontology (dpbo), DataPLANT provides an intermediate ontology that acts as a broker and bridge between the individual researcher/domain experts and main ontology providers.  

Nfdi4plants_ontology enables easy and agile collection of missing vocabulary as well as relationships between terms for (meta)data annotation using DataPLANTâ€™s Swate tool. 

# Your contribution
